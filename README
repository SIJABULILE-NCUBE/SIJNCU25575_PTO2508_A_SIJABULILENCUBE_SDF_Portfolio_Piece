# 🌿 SDF – Final Portfolio Piece

This project is my final portfolio piece for Software Development Fundamentals.   
It is built using **HTML5 and CSS3**, and is a faithful implementation of a provided Figma design.

The goal of the project was to accurately recreate the layout, spacing, colours, typography, and component structure seen in the Figma file while keeping the site responsive and professionally coded.

## 🎨 Figma Reference  
All sizes, colours, spacing, grid layouts and typography were taken directly from the official Figma design:
